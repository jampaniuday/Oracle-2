What Is ERP?
What is ERP System? (Enterprise Resource Planning)
ERP stands for enterprise resource planning. It refers to the systems and software packages used by organizations 
of all sizes to manage day-to-day business activities, such as accounting, procurement, project management, and manufacturing.

ERP systems tie together and define a plethora of business processes and enable the flow of data between them. By 
collecting an organization’s shared transactional data from multiple sources, ERP systems eliminate data duplication and 
provide data integrity with a “single source of truth.”

Today, ERP systems are critical for managing thousands of businesses of all sizes and in all industries. 
To these companies, ERP is as indispensable as the electricity that keeps the lights on.
