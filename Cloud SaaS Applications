Oracle Executive Chairman and CTO Larry Ellison announces next-generation cloud applications 
built on machine learning, voice-driven user interface, and the Generation 2 cloud platform.


What Is a Software-as-a-Service Cloud Suite?

Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to subscribe and use application software in the cloud. 
A modern cloud suite provides complete software for your entire business so that you can subscribe to
certain SaaS applications as needed, such as accounting, HR, marketing, procurement, project management, sales management, 
service, supply chain, and transportation management.

A modern SaaS cloud application suite enables users to personalize software for their role. 
With a modern SaaS suite, you can easily connect your entire business from any device, anywhere. 
You can connect to other clouds and integrate to existing systems. Modern SaaS applications are designed to be secure at every layer 
of the cloud. Modern best practice processes and embedded data-driven intelligence are built in—not added in later. 
Oracle’s complete, modern SaaS applications offer you all this from the industry’s most flexible, 
proven, and secure cloud infrastructure.
